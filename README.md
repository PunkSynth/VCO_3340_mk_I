# VCO 3340 mk I
VCO 3340 is a voltage controlled oscillator based on the ic-circuit AS3340 which is a reproduction of CEM3340 wich was populated in many famous synthezisers e.g. Sequential Circuits Profet 5 rev. 3.

## Introduction
The design of the the VCO 3340 is an Eurorack 15 HP width with a sandwitch structure.

## Schematics
The schematic and the BOM-list is provided as pdf-documents.

## Layout
Four pictures are provided to show how the PCBs are populated.
In the picture of the VCO panel PCB there is a modification. Two voltage follower buffers (TL072) has been added to the "Fine_Buf" and the "Coars_Buf" to achieve the correct signal level.
